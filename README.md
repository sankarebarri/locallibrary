An online catalog for a local library where any visitor can browse the number of books and authors.
All authenticated users can browse books borrowed from  the library and their status(if it's returned date is due or not).
Only authenticated users with staff priviledge can see the name of the borrower of the book and can renew it's returned date, create new book, and add new authors to the
library store.
Non-authenticated users can sign-up.
